description: Implement the code change for a ticket, following this repo's CLAUDE.md conventions, once requirements/code-scan/clarifications are already settled. Use after confirm-edge-cases, standalone or as part of ticket-flow.

# Implement change

1. Read the workspace's Requirements, Code scan, Clarifications, and Decisions
   sections first — implement from those, not from re-deriving requirements or
   re-litigating an already-answered edge case.
2. If the branch for this issue doesn't exist yet, create it per `docs/branching.md`
   (or use the `new-ticket` skill if starting completely fresh). If resuming, check
   `git status`/`git log` before assuming a clean start.
3. For anything touching more than 2-3 files or with a real architectural choice, use
   `EnterPlanMode` before writing code, even inside this flow — a checkpoint on
   *approach* is different from this skill's own step-level gate, and still worth it
   for a non-trivial change.
4. Implement, following `CLAUDE.md`'s conventions:
   - Convention plugins for any new module (`new-module` skill)
   - `MutableStateFlow`/`asStateFlow()` + `UiState` for any ViewModel state
   - Intent/exported-component care if touching manifest components
     (`intent-security-review` skill)
   - Fakes-over-mocks if adding tests inline (see `testing-strategy`)
5. Record any real implementation-level tradeoff in Decisions — not a restatement of
   the diff, but *why* one approach was chosen over another when it mattered.
6. Append to Progress log after each meaningful chunk of work, not only once at the
   end — this is what makes an interrupted implementation resumable.

## Output

Report the files changed and why (a short list, not the full diff) — `run-tests` picks
up from here.
